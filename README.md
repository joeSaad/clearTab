# clearTab

## Description

clearTab is a chrome theme to add contrast to currently used tab. 
It still needs some modifications but it does serve the purpose for now. 

## Installation 

Just download the repo and drag it into your Chrome Settings. 

## Todo 

Fixing the navigation buttons colors since they lose contrast with this theme, tried a number of fixes which did not work.
